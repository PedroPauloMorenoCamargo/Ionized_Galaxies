                <h2> What does the library do ? </h2>
                <p> The provided Python library aims to assist individuals immersed in scientific pursuits. 
                    This initiative originated when my advisor highlighted a common issue among doctoral 
                    studentsâ€”many invest time coding to explore elements in ionized galaxies, 
                    only to lose their code in the end. This project endeavors to address this problem, 
                    offering a free solution accessible to all. Our primary objective is to support as many users as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, the pipeline involves converting an image to grayscale, applying a Fourier transform, 
                    implementing a pass-band filter, and filtering the original image for the specified band.
                    This process enables the focused study of a particular element, 
                    such as hydrogen, by adjusting the band frequency.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Subsequently, 
                    the masked image undergoes an inverse Fourier transformation, 
                    followed by the application of a Sobel filter to delineate the 
                    contours of the studied element. Next, skeletonization consolidates these contours into a singular curve.
                </p>
                <div class="image-section3">
                    <img src="phase2.jpg" alt="Partners">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, the contour of the studied element is juxtaposed with the original image, 
                    allowing scientists to conduct a more nuanced examination of their galaxy or any other relevant context. 
                    This comprehensive approach enhances your ability to study and understand complex images, 
                    providing a valuable tool for scientific exploration.
