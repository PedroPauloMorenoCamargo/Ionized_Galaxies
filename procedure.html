                <h2> What does the library do ? </h2>
                <p> The provided Python library aims to assist individuals immersed in scientific pursuits.
                    This initiative originated when my advisor highlighted a common issue among doctoral
                    studentsâ€”many invest time coding to explore elements in ionized galaxies,
                    only to lose their code in the end. This project endeavors to address this problem,
                    offering a free solution accessible to all. Our primary objective is to support as many users as
                    possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, the pipeline involves converting an image to grayscale, applying a Fourier transform,
                    implementing a pass-band filter, and filtering the original image for the specified band.
                    This process enables the focused study of a particular element,
                    such as hydrogen, by adjusting the band frequency.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Subsequently,
                    the masked image undergoes an inverse Fourier transformation,
                    followed by the application of a Sobel filter to delineate the
                    contours of the studied element. Next, skeletonization consolidates these contours into a singular
                    curve.
                </p>
                <div class="image-section3">
                    <img src="img/templates/phase2.jpg" alt="Partners">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, the contour of the studied element is juxtaposed with the original image,
                    allowing scientists to conduct a more nuanced examination of their galaxy or any other relevant
                    context.
                    This comprehensive approach enhances your ability to study and understand complex images,
                    providing a valuable tool for scientific exploration.

                <h2> Emission Spectra - How dooes it works ? </h2>
                <p>
                    Every chemical element possesses a unique emission spectrum, akin to its fingerprint. When this
                    spectrum is analyzed, distinct bands become visible against a background of darkness. These colored
                    lines represent the emitted light, enabling the identification of specific elements present in the
                    ionized galaxy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the library, scientists can input the desired frequency range for study. By specifying the
                    maximum and minimum frequencies within the band of interest, they can explore one of the possible
                    bands emitted by the ionized galaxy. This functionality empowers researchers to focus their analysis
                    on specific spectral regions, providing a more targeted and insightful examination of the galactic
                    emission.

                    The image above serves as an ideal input due to the minimal presence of smaller galaxies. It is a
                    clean image, with the primary focus on the galaxy positioned prominently at the center, making it
                    conducive for analysis.

                <p>To leverage Fourier transform in image processing, it is imperative to convert the image to
                    grayscale.</p>

                    The magnitude spectrum in the context of Fourier transform refers to a representation of the
                    magnitudes of the various frequency components present in an image. When an image undergoes Fourier
                    transformation, it is transformed from its spatial domain to its frequency domain. The magnitude
                    spectrum graphically illustrates the amplitudes or strengths of different frequencies that
                    contribute to the overall composition of the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In simpler terms, the magnitude spectrum provides a visual insight into the intensity or importance
                    of different frequency patterns within the image. Higher peaks in the spectrum indicate dominant
                    frequencies, helping analysts identify key features and patterns present in the image.
                </p>
                <div class="image-section3">
                    <img src="img/good_exemple/horizontal.png" alt="Partners">

                <p>
                    The horizontal profile graphics illustrate the magnitude as a function of the frequencies
                    identified. As we plan to apply a passband filter, these graphics serve as a valuable tool for
                    visualizing the frequency limits that will be targeted. By examining this profile, it becomes easier
                    to identify the specific range of frequencies where the filter will be applied, aiding in the
                    precise determination of the passband for further processing.
                </p>

                <p>

                    The mask is the outcome of filtering the magnitude spectrum with the user-selected frequencies. To
                    ensure a smooth transition and avoid abrupt changes, a Gaussian smoothing was applied to the mask.
                    This additional step contributes to a more refined and visually coherent result in the frequency
                    domain, providing a foundation for subsequent processing steps.
                </p>

                    The "image back" represents the outcome of filtering the grayscale image using the previously
                    generated mask. With this step, the processing is nearing completion, revealing the areas of
                    interest defined by the user-selected frequencies. The application of the mask to the grayscale
                    image emphasizes specific features within the frequency domain, contributing to the identification
                    and isolation of relevant information in the overall image.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    The Sobel filter utilizes derivatives to compute the edges in the image, highlighting contours in
                    the processed "image back." This step enhances the visibility of sharp transitions in intensity,
                    aiding in the identification of distinct features and boundaries within the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, following the Sobel operation, an algorithm called skeletonize is applied. This
                    algorithm utilizes image morphology to streamline the Sobel's output into a single, continuous
                    contour. This process condenses the Sobel's detailed output, preparing the image for the final steps
                    in the processing pipeline.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p> The concluding step involves combining the input image with the skeletonized contour, resulting in
                    the display of the final output. This is achieved by utilizing an additive weighting for both
                    images. The weighted combination ensures a harmonious integration of the original image and the
                    enhanced contour, providing a comprehensive and visually informative representation in the ultimate
                    result.

                    This serves as a less-than-ideal example of an input image due to the presence of numerous smaller
                    galaxies surrounding the primary image. It is recommended to avoid using such images as input for
                    more optimal and accurate results in your processing pipeline.

                    Following the entire processing pipeline with a suboptimal input image may result in numerous small
                    contours appearing around the main image. This can be counterproductive and, to mitigate this issue,
                    it is advisable to consider cropping the image and eliminating these extraneous elements. Doing so
                    will enhance the clarity of the final output and contribute to a more meaningful and accurate
                    representation.
