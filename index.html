                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    Our project's objective is to create a specialized Python library for the analysis of ionized
                    galaxies, tailored to support individuals involved in scientific research on this subject. The
                    library provides essential tools for examining the chemical elements present in input images. Our
                    aim is to facilitate a thorough investigation, enabling scientists to identify the types and
                    locations of these elements within the input image and enhance the clarity of their research.</p>
                <p>Essentially, the library employs a passband filter on the input image, along with additional steps,
                    to generate an output image highlighting the studied regions through encirclement. For a deeper
                    understanding of the library's functionalities, please visit the procedure page! </p>
